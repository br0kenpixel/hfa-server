# HFA Web Server

**H**TTP **F**ile **A**ccess is a simple web server that allows you to access files on your computer from any device on your network using simple REST API calls. Compared to WebDAV, FTP and similar protocols, its main advantage is that it allows interacting with parts of files, not just the whole file. This makes it ideal for accessing and modifying certain portions of files instead of having to deal with the whole file.
